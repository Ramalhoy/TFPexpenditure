# Total factor productivity and public spending of Brazilian states: a panel data applications


# Abstract
This work aimed to verify the relationships between the total factor
productivity (TFP) of the Brazilian states and their public expenditures by functions,
namely: judiciary; legislative; administration/planning; education and culture;
industry, commerce and services; science and technology; social assistance and
pension; and, health. The analyzes covered the period from 2003 to 2018, and, for the
econometric estimates, the panel data methodology was adopted. Control variables
were used to give robustness to the results. The results reveal that most expenditures
did not have significant relations on total factor productivity, with the exception of
expenditures on health and the judiciary, but which had relatively small correlations.

# The problem
The main reasoning behind this research is that, while there is some evidence about how the TFP behaves in regards to public expenditure, the evidences for the correlations between the TFP and public expenditure by function in state level analysis are very limited or nonexistent, at least for the brazilian case. In this regard, our main interest revolved around estimating this relation, while the method for TFP calculation needed some workarounds. Some concessions regarding data availabity had to be done as well.
