# Total factor productivity and public spending of Brazilian states: a panel data applications


# Abstract
This work aimed to verify the relationships between the total factor
productivity (TFP) of the Brazilian states and their public expenditures by functions,
namely: judiciary; legislative; administration/planning; education and culture;
industry, commerce and services; science and technology; social assistance and
pension; and, health. The analyzes covered the period from 2003 to 2018, and, for the
econometric estimates, the panel data methodology was adopted. Control variables
were used to give robustness to the results. The results reveal that most expenditures
did not have significant relations on total factor productivity, with the exception of
expenditures on health and the judiciary, but which had relatively small correlations.
